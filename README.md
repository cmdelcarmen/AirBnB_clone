# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console  

Written by Caroline Del Carmen and Jose Vazquez.  

Project Goals:  

•Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of our future instances  
•Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file  
•Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel  
•Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.  
•Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
